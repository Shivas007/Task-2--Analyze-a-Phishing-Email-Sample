Notes:
- The display name shows 'SBI Bank' but the sending domain is `bank-secure.com` (not an official SBI domain).
- Link destination `sbi-security-update.com` is not a legitimate bank domain (domain differs from display name).
- Reply-To and Return-Path point to third-party domains unrelated to the bank (classic spoofing technique).
